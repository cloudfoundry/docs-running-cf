title: Identifying your Cloud Foundry API Endpoint and Version
owner: CAPI
---


The API endpoint, or target URL, for your Cloud Foundry instance is the URL of the Cloud Controller. This topic explains how to find your API endpoint from the command line, along with your version of the Cloud Controller API. You can also consult your cloud operator to find out this information.

From a command line, use the [cf api](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/api.html) command to view your API endpoint and Cloud Controller API (CC API) version number:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf api
API endpoint: https://api.example.com (API version: 2.55.0)
</pre>
