title: Configuring SSH access for Tanzu Platform Application Service
owner: Diego

This topic describes how to configure your <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> deployment to allow SSH access to application instances, and includes details about load balancing SSH sessions.

## <a id='architecture-configuration'></a> <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> configuration

To enable SSH access to apps running on Diego, you must configure the properties in your deployment manifests by following the steps below.

To configure manifest properties, you can edit them directly or put them in stub files with [merge tags](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff#-merge-) that you pass to `generate_deployment_manifest` or another spiff-based manifest-generation script.

### <a id='requirements'></a> Generate a key pair

Enabling SSH access requires generating a RSA key pair for your SSH proxy. Generate a unique key pair for each deployment.

In recent versions of <code>cf-deployment</code>, this key pair is automatically generated and stored in <code>credhub</code>.

1. Generate your key pair, entering an empty string for the passphrase when prompted.

  <pre class="terminal">$ ssh-keygen -f ssh-proxy-host-key.pem
  $ ssh-keygen -lf ssh-proxy-host-key.pem.pub | cut -d ' ' -f2 > ssh-proxy-host-key-fingerprint
  </pre>

  <p class="note">
  <span class="note__title"><strong>Note</strong></span>
  ssh-keygen print the SHA256 fingerprint hashes of the keys. To obtain MD5 hashes of the server key fingerprints, use the <code>-E</code> option to specify the hash algorithm.</p>

  <pre class="terminal">$ ssh-keygen -f ssh-proxy-host-key.pem
  $ ssh-keygen -E md5 -lf ssh-proxy-host-key.pem.pub | sed 's/MD5://' | cut -d ' ' -f2 > ssh-proxy-host-key-fingerprint
  </pre>

1. Locate your PEM-encoded private key in `ssh-proxy-host-key.pem` and your public key fingerprint in `ssh-proxy-host-key-fingerprint`. You will need to copy the contents of these files into your Cloud Foundry and Diego manifests.

### <a id='cf-manifest'></a> Configure your Cloud Foundry manifest

Your manifest for Cloud Foundry should include the following properties:

  <pre>properties:
    app\_ssh:
      host\_key\_fingerprint: HOST-KEY-FINGERPRINT
      oauth\_client\_id: ssh-proxy
    cc:
      allow\_app\_ssh\_access: true
      default\_app\_ssh\_access: SSH-ACCESS-FOR-NEW-APPS
    uaa:
      clients:
        ssh-proxy:
          authorized-grant-types: authorization\_code
          autoapprove: true
          override: true
          redirect-uri: /login
          scope: openid,cloud\_controller.read,cloud\_controller.write,cloud\_controller.admin
          secret: SSH-PROXY-SECRET
  </pre>

1. Change `HOST-KEY-FINGERPRINT` to the public key fingerprint of the RSA key pair that you generated. It should be located in your `ssh-proxy-host-key-fingerprint` file.

1. Replace `SSH-ACCESS-FOR-NEW-APPS` with `true` to enable SSH access for new apps by default in spaces that allow SSH. If you set this property to `false`, developers can still enable SSH after pushing their apps by running `cf enable-ssh APP-NAME`. If an app is already deployed and running, the developer must restart the app before being able to SSH into it.

1. For `SSH-PROXY-SECRET`, provide a client secret that Diego will use to register the `ssh-proxy` client with your Tanzu User Account and Authentication (Tanzu UAA) server.

### <a id='diego-manifest'></a> Configure your Diego manifest

Your manifest for Diego should include the following properties:

  <pre>properties:
    ssh\_proxy:
      host\_key: |
        -----BEGIN EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY
        -----END EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
      enable\_cf\_auth: true
      enable\_diego\_auth: false
      diego\_credentials: ""
      uaa\_secret: SSH-PROXY-SECRET
  </pre>

1. `ssh_proxy.host_key`: Supply the PEM-encoded private key from the RSA key pair that you originally generated for your deployment. This key secures the SSH proxy that brokers connections to individual app containers.
1. Specify CF Authentication only by setting `enable_cf_auth` to `true` and `enable_diego_auth` to `false`, as in the example above.
1. For `SSH-PROXY-SECRET`, enter the same secret you provided in the `ssh-proxy.secret` field in your Cloud Foundry manifest.

## <a id="ssh-load-balancer-configuration"></a> SSH load balancer configuration

### <a id="ha-proxy"></a>Using HAProxy

If you are using the HAProxy job as the Gorouter load balancer and you set the `cc.allow_app_ssh_access` property in your Cloud Foundry manifest to `true`, HAProxy serves as the load balancer for Diego's SSH proxies. Use this configuration for deployments where all traffic on the system domain and its subdomains is directed towards the HAProxy job, as is the case for a BOSH-Lite Cloud Foundry deployment on the default `bosh-lite.com` domain.

### <a id="aws"></a>Using Elastic load balancers on AWS

For Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments, where the infrastructure offers load-balancing as a service through Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), the deployment operator can provision an ELB to load balance across the Diego SSH proxy instances. This ELB should be configured to listen to TCP traffic on the port given by the `app_ssh.port` property in the Cloud Foundry manifest and to send it to port `2222`.

In the Diego manifest, register the SSH proxies with your ELBs by editing the `cloud_properties` values.

* If you used the spiff-based manifest-generation templates to produce the Diego manifest, the `cloud_properties` hashes should be specified in the `iaas_settings.resource_pool_cloud_properties` section of the `iaas-settings.yml` stub.
* Otherwise, add the ELB identifier to the `elbs` property in the `cloud_properties` hash of the Diego manifest `access_zN` resource pools. For example:

  <pre><code>resource\_pools:
  - cloud\_properties:
      elbs:
      - test-SSHProxyEL-16O57T64U5UAL
    name: access\_z1
    network: diego1
  - cloud\_properties:
      elbs:
      - test-SSHProxyEL-16O57T64U5UAL
    name: access\_z2
    network: diego2
  - cloud\_properties:
      elbs:
      - test-SSHProxyEL-16O57T64U5UAL
    name: access_z3
    network: diego3
  </code></pre>

## <a id="disable-ssh"></a> Deactivate SSH

If you want to deactivate SSH access for a deployment:

1. Set the `cc.allow_app_ssh_access` property in your Cloud Foundry manifest to `false`.

1. Redeploy Cloud Foundry.

If you want to reset your deployment to remove all SSH proxy configuration:

1. Set the `cc.allow_app_ssh_access` property in your Cloud Foundry manifest to `false`.

1. Delete the `ssh-proxy` properties within `uaa.clients` in your Cloud Foundry manifest.

1. Redeploy Cloud Foundry.

1. Install the Tanzu UAA Command Line Interface (UAAC).
<pre class="terminal">$ gem install cf-uaac</pre>

1. Target your Tanzu UAA server.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac target uaa.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</pre>

1. Authenticate and retrieve your admin client token. When prompted with `Client secret`, enter your admin credentials.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac token client get admin
Client secret:  ********************
Successfully fetched token via client credentials grant.
Target: <span>https</span>://uaa.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
Context: admin, from client admin</pre>

1. Delete your `ssh-proxy` client.
<pre class="terminal">$ uaac token client delete ssh-proxy</pre>
