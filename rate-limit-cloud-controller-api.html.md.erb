title: Rate Limit Information Returned by the Cloud Controller API
owner: CAPI
---

The Cloud Controller API includes rate limit information in the HTTP header. Each header includes the following:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 56
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873
```

Use this table to understand the rate limit header.

<table>
<th>Field Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
 <tr>
 	<td>X-RateLimit-Limit</td>
 	<td>The maximum number of attempts per UAA user (if authenicated) or IP address (if unauthenticated).</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 	<td>X-RateLimit-Remaining</td>
 	<td>The number of attempts remaining.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 	<td>X-RateLimit-Reset</td>
 	<td>The time remaining before the rate limit counter resets, in UTC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">epoch seconds</a>.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

When requests exceed the rate limit value, the Cloud Controller API returns a `429: Too Many Requests` error code.
